# Movie-Dataset-Analysis

The analysis was done using Jupyter Notebook using Python.
This project aims to explore the highest movie earning (gross) and to see which features might influenced the earning.
A correlation was found between movie gross and budget and a regression was done with the two features.
Other than budget, votes was also found to have a higher correlation.

The correlation between features is simplified in the matrix:
